### Welcome to the Modeling App
This application connects your DHIS2 data to the Climate & Health Modeling Platform (CHAP).
CHAP is an open platform for climate-informed disease forecasting, enabling collaboration between researchers, epidemiological models, and health practitioners.

The Modeling App is designed to be simple and intuitive. However, understanding a few core concepts will help you navigate the platform more effectively:

- How to perform the initial setup of the platform
- What models are and how they function
- How to evaluate whether a model produces accurate predictions using your data
- Iterate on model configurations to get better results
- How to generate predictions using a validated model
