# Getting Started with CHAP

Welcome to the CHAP (Climate Health Adaptation Platform) modeling application. This guide will help you understand the basics of using the platform.

## What is CHAP?

CHAP is a platform for building climate-health models that can predict disease outbreaks based on climate data. It helps public health officials prepare for and respond to climate-sensitive diseases.

## Key Features

- **Model Configuration**: Set up predictive models with customizable parameters
- **Data Integration**: Import climate and health data from various sources
- **Visualization**: View predictions and historical data through interactive charts
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance with comprehensive metrics

## Sample Data Visualization

Below is an example of how data might be visualized in CHAP:

<DataVisualization
  type="line"
  title="Monthly Disease Cases"
  data={[
    { month: 'Jan', cases: 120 },
    { month: 'Feb', cases: 150 },
    { month: 'Mar', cases: 200 },
    { month: 'Apr', cases: 180 },
    { month: 'May', cases: 160 },
    { month: 'Jun', cases: 140 },
  ]}
/>

## Next Steps

Once you've completed the initial setup, you can:

1. Explore the **Models** section to see available prediction models
2. Check the **Evaluation** section to understand model performance
3. Review **Settings** to customize your experience
