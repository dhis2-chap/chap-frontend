# Getting Started with CHAP

Welcome to the CHAP (Climate Health Adaptation Platform) modeling application. This guide will help you understand the basics of using the platform.

## What is CHAP?

CHAP is a platform for building climate-health models that can predict disease outbreaks based on climate data. It helps public health officials prepare for and respond to climate-sensitive diseases.

## Key Features

- **Model Configuration**: Set up predictive models with customizable parameters
- **Data Integration**: Import climate and health data from various sources
- **Visualization**: View predictions and historical data through interactive charts
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance with comprehensive metrics

## Getting Started Steps

<Stepper>
  <Step title="Configure your CHAP server">
    First, ensure your CHAP server is running and accessible. The application needs to connect to a backend server to function properly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your organization unit hierarchy">
    Navigate to the configuration section to set up your geographic hierarchy. This determines where predictions will be generated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import your data">
    Import historical climate and health data that will be used to train your models.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a model">
    Use the model builder to create and configure your predictive model based on your data and requirements.
  </Step>
</Stepper>

## Sample Data Visualization

Below is an example of how data might be visualized in CHAP:

<DataVisualization
  type="line"
  title="Monthly Disease Cases"
  data={[
    { month: 'Jan', cases: 120 },
    { month: 'Feb', cases: 150 },
    { month: 'Mar', cases: 200 },
    { month: 'Apr', cases: 180 },
    { month: 'May', cases: 160 },
    { month: 'Jun', cases: 140 },
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning">
The data shown above is sample data for demonstration purposes only.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

Once you've completed the initial setup, you can:

1. Explore the **Models** section to see available prediction models
2. Check the **Evaluation** section to understand model performance
3. Review **Settings** to customize your experience
