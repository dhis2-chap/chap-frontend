# Getting Started

Welcome to the Climate & Health Analytics Platform (CHAP). CHAP is an open platform for climate-informed disease forecasting. It connects researchers and epidemiological models to health practitioners, integrating directly with DHIS2—the world's leading health information system.

## Platform Components

- **Chap Core**: Python engine for model orchestration, data pipelines, validation, and hyperparameter tuning
- **Modeling App**: User interface for training models, visualizing predictions, and evaluating accuracy
- **Climate App**: Import weather and environmental data from sources like ERA5-Land

## Sample Data Visualization

<DataVisualization
  type="line"
  title="Monthly Disease Cases"
  data={[
    { month: 'Jan', cases: 120 },
    { month: 'Feb', cases: 150 },
    { month: 'Mar', cases: 200 },
    { month: 'Apr', cases: 180 },
    { month: 'May', cases: 160 },
    { month: 'Jun', cases: 140 },
  ]}
/>

## Next Steps

1. Select your health data and climate indicators
2. Train a predictive model
3. Evaluate model performance
4. Generate forecasts
