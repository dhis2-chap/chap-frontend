# CHAP Frontend Monorepo

The CHAP Frontend Monorepo is designed to serve two applications: a DHIS2 app named Prediction App and a Standalone Visualizer App named chap-eval designed to be used by those who are running CHAP without DHIS2. The monorepo includes common React components that are shared between the two applications.
